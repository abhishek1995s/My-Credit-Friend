  <p>The movie is great. The first half kept me hanging and waiting for more while the second half managed to deliver to my expectations. A must watch movie!</p>

  <p>A dream within a dream within a dream. What a concept ! As complex as it was, the entertainment factor was not lost. The intricacies in the story kept me intrigued throughout the movie. Awesome experience watching thing this movie. </p>

  <p>A total waste of money. I couldn't understand most of what was in the story which seems to have been the intention of the creators of this movie. Wouldn't recommend anyone without godly patience to watch this movie. Had a horrible time watching this one.</p>

  <p>Usually I try to be careful with over hyping a film, or setting the expectations too high, as film geeks all are guilty for, however for Christopher Nolan's Inception, this really is not possible.This is possibly one of the only perfect films I have ever seen. It is absolutely confident in every way, something which is extremely refreshing</p>

  <p>Inception has a lot of ideas and it doesn't do anything with them. The hype around this movie made me really expecta  lot of things out of it, but honestly, it didn't deliver. Disappointing movie.</p>

  <p>Insipid- the pointless film.There is no plot, character or soul to this film. It's like having a beautiful building on the outside with no paint or decoration on the inside.There is no tension; you couldn't care less about any of the characters, why were they even motivated to do what they did.</p>

  <p>Insulting.I want to stress the fact that the only complexity in this movie is trying to figure out how you can invest so much money in a script that continuously makes a fool of the average critic intelligent viewer! It is deliberately confusing in order to conceal its stupidity. Nothing that really matters is explained in the movie.

  <p>Inception - A benchmark in all cinema to come.A script that has been worked on for over a decade, Nolan's endeavours are inescapable in its pure complexity and brilliance - quite simply, one of the best film story lines audiences will have encountered in their lifetime. All this is supplemented superbly by the film's ensemble cast.</p>

  <p>Overrated.This movie is so predictable that it takes all of 10 minutes to figure it out. At that stage you know you're going to waste another 2 and a half hours watching the nonsense where people slip in and out of dreams in an attempt to fabricate a story where there was no story.</p>
